# Show-External-IP-2.0
This extensionâ€™s primary objective is to detect and show the current external IP address, Location and Timezone in a convenient panel. In technical terms, the extension sends a simple GET request to the address https://ipinfo.io/json that will provide us a JSON response that contains information such as city, province, country, time zone and location coordinates. We can use this information to let user know the location of the external IP address.
